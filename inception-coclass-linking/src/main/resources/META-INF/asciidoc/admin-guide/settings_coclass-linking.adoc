= CoClass Linking

== Prerequisites 
The recommender relies on the existence of a knowledge base to construct a concept lookup table. Hence, before configuring the recommender, a knowledge base needs to be imported (see <<Knowledge Bases>>) and the named entity layer needs to be configured to use the concepts as features in the project settings. The following screenshots shows the typically used settings.

== Configuring the recommender
The recommender needs to be configured in the project settings as shown in the screenshot below.
The currently configurable options are:

* Confidence threshold: recommendations with a lower score are discarded and not shown
* Maximum rejects: recommendations that were rejected _n_ times are not shown anymore

Once the recommender has been saved and is enabled, it will be used in the annotation task.
